The adaptation works by explicitly estimating the truncation error and round-off error, and choosing the step size to optimally balance those. The truncation error is given by the magnitude of the Pth order derivative, which will be estimated with another finite difference method (bound_estimator). This finite difference method, bound_estimator, will be tasked with estimating the Pth order derivative in a neighbourhood, not just at some x. To do this, it will use a careful reweighting of the function evaluations to estimate the Pth order derivative at, in the case of a central method, x - h, x, and x + h, where h is the step size. The coeffients for this estimate, the neighbourhood estimate, are given by the three sets of coeffients in bound_estimator.coefs_neighbourhood. The round-off error is estimated by the round-off error of the function evaluations performed by bound_estimator. The trunction error is amplified by condition, and the round-off error is amplified by factor. The quantities ∇f_magnitude_mult and f_error_mult are precomputed quantities that facilitate the step size adaptation procedure.\n\nFields\n\ngrid::SVector{P,Int}: Multiples of the step size that the function will be evaluated at.\ncoefs::SVector{P,Float64}: Coefficients corresponding to the grid functions that the   function evaluations will be weighted by.\ncoefs_neighbourhood::NTuple{3,SVector{P,Float64}}: Sets of coefficients used for   estimating the magnitude of the derivative in a neighbourhood.\ncondition::Float64: Condition number.
